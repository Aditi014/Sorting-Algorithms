### A Selection Sort works as follows:
* We look at the first item in the array. This is 5. Next we search the whole Array for the smallest number (1). Once we find that, we swap the numbers.
* Now with the smallest number in the first position. We look at the next number (3), find the next smallest number (2) and swap them.
* We continue this until all the numbers are sorted! 


### Pseudocode Example:

### This is a very common sorting algorithm and can be implemented in pretty much every language.<br>Check out the rest of this folder to see some examples of it at work!
