### A bubble sort works as follows:

* Compares first 2 numbers in array. Will swap them if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
* Goes onto the next 2 numbers, does the same for the rest. Compare, check if larger and switch if needed.
* Now we know that the final number in the array is the largest.
* We repeat the process all again, slowly confirming that we have the largest number after swapping and reaching the end of the array.
